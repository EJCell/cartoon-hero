		<h2>About WALL•E</h2>
		<p>WALL•E is a small, sentient, and curious waste-collecting robot who is the last of his kind left on Earth. He has a box-like appearance, with caterpillar tracks for movement and a pair of expressive binocular-like eyes. WALL•E is equipped with various tools for compacting and organizing trash, which he diligently collects and stacks into tall skyscraper-like structures. Despite his humble and seemingly monotonous existence, WALL•E possesses a charming and inquisitive personality, demonstrating curiosity about the remnants of human civilization and a desire for companionship which we can see in his relationship with EVE, another robot.</p>
