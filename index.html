		<h2>ABOUT WALL•E</h2>
		<p><b>WALL•E</b> is a small, sentient, and curious waste-collecting robot who is the last of his kind left on Earth. He has a <b>box-like appearance</b>, with caterpillar tracks for movement and a pair of expressive binocular-like eyes. WALL•E is equipped with various tools for compacting and <b>organizing trash</b>, which he diligently collects and stacks into tall skyscraper-like structures. Despite his humble and seemingly monotonous existence, WALL•E possesses a <b>charming and inquisitive personality</b>, demonstrating curiosity about the remnants of human civilization and a desire for companionship which we can see in his relationship with <b>EVE</b>, another robot.</p>
